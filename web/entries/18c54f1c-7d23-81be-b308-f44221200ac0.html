	comment: `Users' preference for Single-Page Web Applications (SPAs) due to their "modern" feel is often unquestioned, but their heavy use of partial page replacement for page navigation can lead to problems. By abstracting the concept of a link, SPAs make web pages feel more like mobile applications, but this can result in unreliable behavior, especially in areas with poor network conditions. The smoothness of an SPA can actually indicate decreased reliability and predictability as a web page.`,
